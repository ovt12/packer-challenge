MongoDB Packer Challenge

In this task, I crafted a Packer.JSON file with configurations for constructing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Afterwards, I launched an AWS instance which enabled me to access the virtual machine (VM) using Secure Shell (SSH). Once inside the VM, I executed the "mongosh" command to gain entry to the database. To confirm that everything was in order, you can see that we run the command mongosh to confirm that it has installed on the virtual machine.
