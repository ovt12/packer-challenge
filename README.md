MongoDB Packer Challenge

In this challenge I have had to create a Packer.JSON file, with configeration that allows me to build an AMI on AWS. Create an instance on AWS that allows me to then SSH into the VM Once in the VM, I am able to run the mongosh command that will allow me access to the database. To test that I have access I have run the show dbs commands to list the available dbs.
